# predict_house_prices
- Predict house prices for districts in california by training and testing appropriate ML model on a dataset containing information of more than 20,000 district records dataset in california.
- 1] Explanatory data analysis to understand the data to select the features and select an appropriate model 
- 2] Data Preprocessing and feature engineering with pandas 
- 3] cleaned and created additional features in the dataset
- 4] matplotlib -visualises data in scatterplot and addes image to the scatterplot for detailed analysis. 
- 5] Dataset is plotted on histogram, to answer appropriate queries.
- 6] Data visualization with seaborn, plotted jointplot, countplot, barplot, heatmap using seaborn.
- 7] Applied zscore to all float values in the dataset, converting categorical feature into dummy variables. Then splitting the dataset into training and test set. Split the train and test data set using pandas library.
- 8] Use RandomForestRegressor to train the model because the dataset had non-linear relationship.
- 9] RandomForestRegressor are also used to find the important features for the model.
